              I love building things that put value into people's lives. I have
              started my career as a frontend developer but then transitioned to
              a full-stack role. I have built multiple React web applications,
              React Native mobile apps and REST APIs with Node. I primarily work
              with JavaScript and also love TypeScript.
              <br />
              <br />I have ~{`${getExpInyears()} `}
              years of experience in the software industry. Because of being a
              frontend developer first, I have great experience in building Web
              and Mobile UIs with complex features and design. Also, tackled
              great challenges in the world of backend too. I prefer to keep
              learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things
              that matter. Iâ€™m a quick learner, able to pick up new skills and
              juggle different projects and roles with relative ease.
